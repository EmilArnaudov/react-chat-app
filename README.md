# Simple Chat React App

 This is my second app in my react learning journey.

#### This app has the following functionalities: 

   - Sign in with an existing Google account.
   - Search for other users.
   - Send instant messages to other users.
   - See if someone is online / If not when he was last online.
   - Send images and videos in the chat.

## App Details
     
   - The app uses React, HTML, CSS in the front-end.
   - Firebase as a back-end.
   - Firestore as database and Firebase Auth for user authentication.
